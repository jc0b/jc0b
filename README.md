### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jacob, a Client Platform Engineer working in Amsterdam.

- I'm currently working on making the endpoint experience at my org seamless and simple for the end user, leveraging modern technologies such as MDM. 
- At the moment, I'm trying to learn Rust, so I can make little utilities for tasks I do frequently.
- In my free time, I love photography and learning to cook new things.
